   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

3. **Use components locally in your React project**
   You can import them directly from the local path:

   import { Button, Text } from '../nova-lux-ui/src/components';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="p-4">
         <Text as="h1">Welcome to NovaLux UI</Text>
         <Button variant="primary" size="md">
           Click Me
