# ðŸ§© Day 1 â€” Project Setup & Foundation

**Date:** 16 Oct 2025
**Focus:** Setting up `nova-lux-ui` â€” the base for the component library.

---

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Initialized project structure**
   - Added `README.md`, initial setup files, and dependencies.
   - Prepared clean folder layout for scalable development.
  
2. **Installed and configured core tools**
   - Integrated **Storybook** for isolated component development.
   - Added **React Router** for internal playground navigation.

3. **Setup Tailwind v4** and basic utility helpers like `cn()` and `types`.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

- Storybook provides an efficient way to test and document UI components in isolation.
- A clean base setup prevents configuration chaos later when the library expands.
- Preparing a playground early ensures real-world component testing beyond Storybook.

## ðŸªž Reflection

The foundation took time but was worth it â€” like building a solid spiritual root before cultivation.
This project now has a clear purpose and direction.
