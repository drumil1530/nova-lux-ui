**Date:** 18 Oct 2025
**Focus:** Building a unified color system and form components (`Input` and `Textarea`).

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Enhanced Semantic Color System**

   - Centralized color logic through `COLOR_MAP` and `resolveColor()` utilities.
   - Added theme-aware styles for both light and dark modes.
2. **Created Text Component**

   - Implemented polymorphic `Text` with support for semantic coloring and themes.
3. **Developed Input & Textarea**

   - Built theme-aware, focus-styled `Input` and `Textarea` components.
   - Added support for radius, resize behavior, and auto-grow functionality.
4. **Improved Storybook**

   - Integrated theme switcher and polished stories for better interaction.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

- Tailwind v4â€™s stance on dynamic color variables requires planned class mapping.
- Form components demand extra care for focus, accessibility, and consistent visual feedback.
- Auto-grow logic and focus rings deepen understanding of React + Tailwind synergy.

## ðŸªž Reflection

From text rendering to interactive inputs, NovaLux UI now feels substantial â€” usable and elegant.
This was a strong finish for Week 1, demonstrating not only growth in technical skill but in **systematic component thinking**.
